For the project of E-government we have created a model to describe any greek public body.

A problem-based project, where we had the chance through weekly meetings to contribute to a wider project.

The final report (35 pages - in Greek language), after an extensive research on files regarding public bodies in Greece and other countries, concludes that a public body, can consist of five main categories of attributes. These are:

1. The public body 
2. Area of supervision
3. Geograhpic base of public body
4. Thematic categorization
5. Legal form

After an exhaustive discussion we came up with several attributes for each category.

For Administrative categorization we concluded on:

* Abbreviation
* Form date
* Alteration date (multiple)
* Type of alteration (multiple)
* Government's decision paper
* Body of origin (multiple)
* Ending body
* Supervised by
* Co-operating body
* Serves body
* Assesed by
* Special comments

For Area of Supervision

* Address
* Postal Code
* State
* Municipality
* Town

For Geograhpic base of public body

* Town

For Thematic categorization we concluded into a signle attribute and 12 main categories, based on categorization of other countries such as the UK, Sweden and the US. Partial examples are: Public order, Justice, Education, Transportation, Economy.

For Legal form we have collected all the possible legal form that a public body in Greece can have (21 types). 
These include the legal bodies of public law, charities, SCE, Limited Companies, SA and others.
