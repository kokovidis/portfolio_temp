In this scenario we predict if an area belongs to an Urban Rural Class ([http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Statistics/About/Methodology/UrbanRuralClassification]()) and more specifically on category 1 (Settlements of 125,000 or more people).  

The plots of coefficients and cross-validation, produced from the Lasso can be found below:



For train data 75% & test data 25%:


The best model for which yields the lowest error, is a linear model with XX variables. The estimation accuracy is XXXX%. And the confusion matrix is the following:



the one standard error rule, the number of selected variables is zero (only an intercept) which yields a 56,40% accuracy

In this case 745 out 1321 test areas are correctly identified.
