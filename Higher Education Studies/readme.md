# Higher Education Studies

After the completion of my secondary studies I have pursed my undergraduate studies in Business Administration (you can find more information regarding the programme in the equivalent sub-folder). This 4-year programme offered me an exposure to a wide range of disciplines. Ultimately, it has helped me to better understand my interests for my future career. During my studies, I have pursued a 14-month administative Internship at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), Geneva, Switzerland. 

At the last optional modules of my undergraduate degree, I had the chance to deal with several topics in Data Science & Machine Learning. My strong interest in these topics, finally led me to collaborate with my professor Konstantinos Tarabanis and join his Information Systems Lab. 

As a Research Assistant in the Infomation System Lab for 2 years (with a break of 6 months due to military obligations) I joined several European-funder Research projects and also develop educational material in several Data Science topics under the guidance of my professor.

In 2019, I joined the masters programme of Business Analytics at the University College London (you can find more information regarding the programme in the equivalent sub-folder).
