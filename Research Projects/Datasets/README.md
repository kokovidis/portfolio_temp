### Datasets from statistics.gov.scot 

**statistics.gov.scot** provides public access to the data behind our official statistics in linked open data format. 

This site is managed by The Scottish Government on behalf of all producers of official statistics in Scotland. It provides statistics from a variety of organisations such as The Scottish Government, National Records of Scotland, NHS Information Services Division and Transport Scotland.

All datasets were retrieved from the portal through SPARQL queries and also with the datacart functionality as .csv files.
