In `coursework` directory you will find all of my relevant coursework for each course during my studies. 
In directory :   

`/Coursework / Electives / Information Systems Development / 2. Linked data & Data Analytics /`
   
   you will find assignments held on linear regression, resampling methods, visualisations **(assignments 5 to 10)**
   
   
And in directory :

`/Coursework/Electives/E-government/`	

you will find a 35-page report for the creation of an attribute model to describe any greek public body. As the final report is in Greek, a brief synopsis in English is provided.

Last but not least, in directory :

`/Coursework/Electives/E-business/`

you will find a project for integrating a bookstore into an e-commerce platform (using php, mysql, apache)
