The purpose of this study is to integrate the pre-existing catalog of the physical store to a web store. The aim is to offer the same functionalities but under an online web store, which can operate in parallel with the physical store.

In this study, we will try to demonstrate, step by step, how an online book store can be set up, based on our “University of Macedonia Press” store.
We will use the Prestashop bundle and for the needs of this study and we will host our web store, in a virtual web server.

In the end of this presentation, a suggestion for an external module is presented.
