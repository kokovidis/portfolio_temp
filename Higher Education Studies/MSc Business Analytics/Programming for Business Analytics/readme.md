# Programming for Business Analytics

The course covered theoretical topics of computational thinking, experimental methodology and empirical methods for training, validation and testing models. In lab sessions it covered the preparation of datasets and simple examples of both supervised and unsupervised methods. The importance of plotting and visualisation for decision support was also emphasised.

The document Workshop Syllabus.pdf provides all of the concepts that were covered in Python. Weekly quizzes examined these concepts. 

### Group Courswork
The coursework gave us the opportunity to apply all these skills in a Machine Learning pipeline with the Employee Attrition dataset of IBM. On our project, we performed an exploratory data analysis in millenials sub-group. In addition, we created an XGBoost Classification Model which predicts whether a millennial employee will stay or leave the company.
