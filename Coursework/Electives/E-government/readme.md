For the project of E-government we have created a model to define the attributes that can describe any greek public body.

A problem-based project, where we had the chance through weekly meetings to contribute to research project H2020 OpenGovIntelligence.

After scraping different documents regarding the public bodies in Greece and other countries, we conclude that a public body, can consist of five main categories of attributes. These are:

__1. The public body (name, contact details, etc.)__

__2. Area of supervision__

__3. Geograhpic base of public body__

__4. Thematic categorization__

__5. Legal form__

After an exhaustive discussion we came up with several attributes for each category.

For the public body category we defined the following:

* Abbreviation
* Form date
* Alteration date (multiple)
* Type of alteration (multiple)
* Government's decision paper
* Body of origin (multiple)
* Ending body
* Supervised by
* Co-operating body
* Serves body
* Assesed by
* Special comments

For Area of Supervision the:

* Address
* Postal Code
* State
* Municipality
* Town

For the Geograhpic base of public body:

* Town
* Address
* Number
* Postal Code
* Municipality
* State


Where for the Thematic categorization we concluded into a single attribute with 12 possible values. We based the attributes on examples of other countries such as the UK, Sweden and the US. Partial examples are the: Public order, Justice, Education, Transportation, Economy.

For the Legal Form we have collected all the possible legal form that a public body in Greece can have (21 types). 
These include the legal bodies of public law, charities, SCE, Limited Companies, SA and others.
