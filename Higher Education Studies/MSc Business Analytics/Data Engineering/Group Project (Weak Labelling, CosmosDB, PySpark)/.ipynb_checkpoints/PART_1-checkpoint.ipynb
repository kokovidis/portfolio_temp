    "As you can see we have acquired flat files in JSON format from the official yelp website. Then we have uploaded one of the files on the CosmosDB platform of Microsoft Azure in the MongoDB database that we have created. Due to the size of the files and the resource restrictions, we were not able to upload all of them. The flat files were then parsed into csv format in order to manipulate them as spark dataframes and we moved on to use the reviews dataframe as the basis of our analysis. This was split into 3 sets: <br>\n",
    "- The <b>development set</b> (500 rows) that was manually labeled and used to perform data understanding, analysis, aggregations feature engineering. This process also involved fetching the file from the MongoDB database to extract information. Then with this set we have created and evaluated the labeling functions. This whole process was iterative, as with each iteration we were imporoving the construction of the labeling functions.<br>\n",
    "-  The <b>train set</b> containing vast amount of data points was sampled to be able to apply efficiently the previously created labeling functions. This resulted to having a weakly labeled train set that was then augmented using data augmentation techniques like transformation functions. The output of this was the train set that we fit our classifiers in order to come to a final prediction.<br>\n",

With a click of a button, Cosmos DB enables you to elastically and independently scale throughput and storage across any number of Azure regions worldwide. You can elastically scale throughput and storage, and take advantage of fast, single-digit-millisecond data access using your favorite API including: SQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, Tables, or Gremlin. \n",

    "- It is flexible not only in terms of resources, but also on the data type formats that it can store. \n",

    "Our goal is to train a classifier over the Yelp data that could predict whether a comment/text is positive (containing suggestions or complaints) or negative. Hence, we have access to a large amount of unlabelled data in the form of Yelp comments with some metadata. After filtered the dataset, we split the filtered review data into training set, testing set and development set. Because originally the dataset doesn't contain any labels, our members manually labelled the reviews in development and testing sets (500 labels for each) with \"1\" for positive and \"0\" for negative. Therefore, the result of our label model can be tested in a reasonable way later."

The use of org.mongodb.spark:mongo-spark-connector_2.11:2.4.1 for making queries on the database, didn't allow us to use the sparknlp package (with its underlying jar files) on the same notebook and vice versa (as we couldn't use the .jar files to connect to the DataBase when we used the sparknlp package.
