### Individual Coursework
In the individual coursework we demonstrate a complete Machine Learning Pipeline with transactional data from Spotify Streaming Service. The final goal was to predict if an artist will become succesful in the future based on some criteria.

The project among others, it covers the steps of sanity checking (validation of the dataset), feature engineering, dimensionality reduction (PCA & kPCA) and imputation. 

For the development of the predictive model, different combinations of Machine Learning models and dimensionality reduction methods are assesed. 

Finally, high importance is given to the business value that come out of this project.
